# Superstore Sales SQL Project

This project explores sales data from a superstore to extract useful insights using SQL. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, regional sales trends, and time-based performance metrics.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Superstore Sales Dataset from Kaggle
- **Table Name**: `superstore_sales`
- **Key Columns**: Order ID, Order Date, Customer Name, Region, State, City, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales

## Objectives

- Understand overall sales performance
- Identify top-performing regions, cities, and customers
- Analyze sales trends by time and category
- Explore customer order patterns and shipping delays

## SQL Topics Covered

- Aggregations
- GROUP BY & ORDER BY
- Date formatting
- Joins and subqueries
- CTEs
- Basic business logic using SQL

## Key Insights

1. Total sales in the dataset  
2. Sales by category and sub-category  
3. Sales by region and state  
4. Monthly sales trend  
5. Top 10 selling cities  
6. Top 10 customers by total sales  
7. Yearly sales overview  
8. Category-wise monthly sales trend  
9. Number of orders by region  
10. Most frequent (repeat) customers  
11. Sales by shipping mode  
12. Top states by total sales  
13. Popular sub-categories  
14. Average order size per customer  
15. Sales by postal code  
16. First-time vs repeat customer revenue  
17. Days between order and ship date

## How to Use

1. Create a database in your SQL environment.
2. Use `superstore_sales_schema.sql` to set up the table.
3. Import the dataset (`Super store sales data.csv`) into the table.
4. Run `superstore_sales_analysis.sql` to execute the queries.

Be sure to select your database first:
```sql
USE superstore_db;
```
